# Jedi Temple Tourist - Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails

## Setup
* Clone this repository
* `bundle`
* `rails db:setup`
* `bin/dev`

## What is this all about?
We created a version of this application in a presentation for the r-rails community.
You can see step by step what we did in the [commits](https://github.com/datae95/presentation_jedi_temple_tourist/commits/main).
There you can find a few explanations, too.

When I used rails tools like `rails g scaffold`, you can see the command in the commit message.
In most cases, I did not change anything in these commits (apart from running the migrations).

I don't recommend working this way for a application, you want to deploy.
This is only suitable for creating a MVP.
